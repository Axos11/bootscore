# bootScore
[bootScore](https://bootscore.me) combines the [Underscores](https://underscores.me) theme boiler template with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) to create a compact starter theme for excellent WordPress projects. It does not contain customizer settings, logo upload functionality, or drag-and-drop features. bootScore is entirely customizable through its .php, .scss, and .js files, necessitating basic coding skills for editing.

Moreover, bootScore seamlessly integrates with Bootstrap and offers complete [WooCommerce](https://woo.com/) support, featuring an integrated AJAX offcanvas cart.

bootScore is a time-saving tool designed to swiftly create clean, mobile-first projects. If you are familiar with Bootstrap and it's HTML classes, you'll feel right at home and be able to build whatever you want.
